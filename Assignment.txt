1) What is a computer?
Ans) A computer is a machine that accepts information (in the form of digitised data) and processes it in accordance with a programme, piece of software, or set of instructions that specify how the information should be handled.

2) What is RAM?
Ans) RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is a type of computer memory that is used to temporarily store data that the computer's central processing unit (CPU) is actively working on. RAM is a volatile memory, which means that the data stored in it is lost when the computer is powered off or restarted.

3) Where is data stored in computer?
Ans) 
Data in a computer is stored in various locations, each serving a different purpose. The primary types of storage in a computer include:
i) Hard Disk Drive (HDD): HDDs are traditional mechanical storage devices that store data on spinning disks. They provide long-term, non-volatile storage for a wide range of data, including the operating system, software applications, documents, media files, and more. Data on an HDD remains intact even when the computer is powered off.
ii) Solid-State Drive (SSD): SSDs are a newer type of storage device that use flash memory to store data. They are faster, more durable, and consume less power than HDDs. SSDs are commonly used for the operating system, frequently accessed applications, and data that requires fast access.
iii) RAM (Random Access Memory): As mentioned in the previous response, RAM is a type of volatile memory that stores data temporarily while the computer is running. It is used for active tasks, open applications, and data that the CPU needs to work on in real-time. RAM is much faster than long-term storage but loses its data when the computer is powered off.
iv) Cache: CPUs often have built-in cache memory that stores frequently used instructions and data to speed up processing. This cache memory is very fast but small in size.

4) What is that input device used to type text and numbers on a document in a computer system? 
Ans) Keyboard 

5) What are the output devices?
Ans) Output devices are hardware components of a computer system that provide information or data to the user or other external devices. They allow the computer to communicate with the outside world by displaying, printing, or transmitting data generated by the computer. Common examples of output devices include: Monitor, printer, speaker, plotter, projector,etc.
 
6) Which is the input device that allows user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen?
Ans) Mouse

7) Which language is directly understood sy the computer without a translation program?
Ans) The only language directly understood by a computer without the need for translation is machine code or binary code. Machine code is a low-level programming language that consists of binary instructions, typically represented as a sequence of 0s and 1s. 

8) What are input devices?
Ans) Input devices are hardware components of a computer system that allow users to provide data, instructions, and commands to the computer. These devices enable communication between the user and the computer by capturing and transmitting data or signals. Common examples of input devices include: Keybord, mouse, touchscreen, trackpad, joystick, stylus, etc.
